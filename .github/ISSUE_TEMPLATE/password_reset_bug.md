about: Report an issue with the password reset functionality
labels: bug, authentication, security

### Description
When a user requests a password reset, they are automatically signed in but are not prompted to set a new password. This creates a security concern as users might expect to be able to change their password during the reset flow.

### Expected Behavior
1. User requests password reset
2. User receives reset email with link
3. Clicking the link should direct user to a password change form
4. After setting new password, user should be signed in

### Current Behavior
1. User requests password reset
2. User receives reset email with link
3. Clicking the link signs user in directly without password change prompt
4. No way to change password during reset flow

### Impact
- Security risk if user's email was compromised
- Poor user experience as password reset expectations aren't met
- Violates standard security practices for password resets

### Proposed Solution
1. Implement password reset form after clicking reset link
2. Require new password entry before signing in
3. Add password strength validation
4. Show success message after password update

### Additional Context
Documented in README under Authentication section and in project memories.
